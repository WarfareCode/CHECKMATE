      <P>
          The "mysimdis.prefs" file in the simdis directory provides a preferences file
          for SIMDIS that is compatible with CHECKMATE.  Specifically, it ensures that
          beams for non-directional radars appear as spherical
          bubbles when they emit.  Other radars will appear as fan or pencil beams as
          appropriate and as specified in their input.  It sets some other preferences as
          well that help to keep the visualization as clean as possible.

      <p>
          To use this preferences file, you have two choices:
          <ol type="1">
              <li>
                  Load it from within SIMDIS under the File->Load Preferences menu
                  entry.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Place it in your ${SIMDIS_HOME} directory.  You will need to 
                  check the environment variable settings for your account on
                  your computer to determine where this is.  If you choose this
                  option, SIMDIS will automatically load the mysimdis.prefs file
                  for you when it is launched.  However, if you use SIMDIS for other
                  projects, then these settings will be applied for those projects
                  as well.
